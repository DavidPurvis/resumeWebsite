                My name is David Purvis, and I am Software Engineering Student from Jackson, MS. Every since I was a
                little boy, I
                was always obsessed with electronics. I was so perplex how solid state object, liked the GameCube,
                could
                produce a NFL game
                that I can control on to my TV. I knew it was not magic, and something had to have been causing the
                game
                to appear on the
                screen and react to the buttons I was pressing on my controller. It was not until later life, when I
                actually found how they
                worked. I became consumed by video games to the point where I wanted to build my own. Upon
                researching
                how to build a
                computer and what parts should I buy, I realized my passion was computers. At the time, however, I
                thought the parts of the
                computer were the most fascinating part of the computer because of how powerful they were and what
                they
                could do. When
                senior year of High School rolled around where I took two coding classes when I found my true love
                was
                coding. I was able to
                pick it up fairly quickly and realized I had a talent for it. Eventually during those classes,
                finishing
                the assigned program for
                each class was not enough, so I began to find ways to minimize the number of lines it took me to
                write
                the code. This is where
                I say the beauty of coding. Now, I am in college at Mississippi State studying software engineering
                just
                like I have always
                wanted to. Maybe one day, I will be able to give back to the industry that has entertained me so
                much.
